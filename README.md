# ML-coding
Hi all, This is my collection of practiced programs from various online free resources. As I learn theory concepts, I do coding. Because we need to spend more time on recall, implement than understand. I do mention the place from where I learnt these. refer my comment section of each program. You may refer those to learn concepts clearly. I do explore new datasets also.
